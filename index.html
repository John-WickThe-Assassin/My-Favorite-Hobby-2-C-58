        <p>I LOVE gaming because its Fun! I Play on a PC!, and more than 1.4 MILLION kids get enhanced with teamwork! and even a little knowledge!,My Favorite game is Roblox,why?,it CAN ALLOW YOU TO MAKE YOUR OWN GAME! also, there are more than a MILLION games on roblox!,my favorites are RFC,A.K.A Roblox Fighting Championship,and Arsenal,and my Top FAVORITE....KAIJU UNIVERSE!in kaiju universe we need to fight Kaijus and Destroy buildings to earn g cells,g cells allow you to BUY KAIJUS! it's a really fun game! but playing games for too long can damage your eyes,so i play for only 1 hour,sometimes 2 hours or 3! but NEVER 4 5 6 OR 7 OR 8 9 OR 10, it hurts your eyes!,so...yeah thats why i Love games,also, Kaiju Universe's Best Kaiju is Godzilla 2021,here is a tip,get 7000 g cells by using some of the weak kaiju and get Godzilla 2014,then buy Godzilla 2019 for 9500 g cells and make them level 30,then get 75k g cells and BAM! you got 2021!.</p>
